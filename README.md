- Include this theme in your Statamic `_themes` directory. (rename it if you'd like)
- Change the `_theme: ???` value in `_config/settings.yaml` to your new theme name
- Open your command line interface and `cd` into the theme directory
- Run `npm install` (You'll need to have node installed. If you don't, [go here first](http://nodejs.org) and install node)
- Run `gulp` (This will compile your project, start livereload and open a PHP server instance at `localhost:8000`)
- Explore the `gulpfile.js` for other individual functions you can run or to customize your build
- Write all your development code in the `dev` folder. This will auto-compile and be delivered to the rest of your project where Statamic can then access it.
